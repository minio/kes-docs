_Optional_

Directs the command to skip x.509 certificate validation during the TLS handshake with the KES server. 
This allows connections to KES servers using untrusted certificates (i.e. self-signed or issued by an unknown Certificate Authority).

MinIO strongly recommends *against* using this option in production environments.
